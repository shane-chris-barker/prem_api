# prem_api
A Symfony 6 and API Platform based Application

This is a simple little application for me to learn Api Platform. It's probably of no use to you, but feel free to download it if you wish to see how I (hopefully)
got it working.

The application is based around a tutorial from the amazing guys over at SymfonyCasts.

The API will return information around the Premier League, it's teams and their players.

It is in no way affiliated, owned by or in assocation with the Premier League, so please don't sue me.

The application uses Foundry to create some base data. You can leverage the endpoints to create more data.

The application will use Swagger to generate documentation.
